## About Japin
In the age of many social media giants, Japin is just a new kid in the block with very limited features and capabilities but having some firsts of its own. Japin is a social network with pictures in each post. People joining Japin can admire people and see their pictures in their feed or wall, rate it from 1 to 5, comment on them and share them. The new thing is the pictures stays in the network based on the number of initial audience of the post and the total stars that post gets. When the post or picture disappears, it adds a medal to the profile depending on the stars that the post received. Japin has an in-built camera and picture editing tool which lets people play around with multiple filters on top of one another. There are many shortcomings of Japin in its present version. There is a cap on the number of admirers that one can have, sharing and searching is very primitive, there is no provision of reply comments etc. Japin is developed entirely by a single person and so its capabilities are limited to the technical and infrastructural limitations of the developer himself. But I promise to work on the problems with the best of my capabilities to make Japin more interesting and engaging. Japin uses some libraries so there are constraints from them also but with time as those constraints diminishes, Japin will mature too.

### FAQs
Below are some possible FAQs which I think, will pop up at first. list of FAQs will increase in future.


* What inspired the name "Japin" and its logo?

The logo of Japin is inspired partially by instagram and the shield of Captain America! The name "Japin" is a short for Just Another Picture Network, and yes it is inspired from "Jarvis" - Just A Rather Very Intelligent System!

* What is the business model of Japin or LoneDev?

Japin is an ad supported free Android app. Japin uses only banner ads and that too only in the activity that talks too much with the server. This is to make the app as less annoying as possible. LoneDev is an independent app creator with no financial backers so keeping ads is the least possible option to make Japin free of cost. It is expected that Japin will earn some more money from showing ads than it will spend in Firebase bills, that more sum is its only revenue for now!

* Who created the artworks, icons etc?

Most of every artwork, icons, promo video etc. is created by LoneDev. I also used some material icons provided by Android Studio especially the ones on the menu drawer. They may not be as professional looking as many mature apps but I do not have the money to pay anyone else right now :)

* Is LoneDev a Marvel Fan?!

Yes! I am a Marvel fan and a die hard fan of Tony Stark AKA Iron Man :) I am also a Google fan and the entire app theme have some similarities with the old Gmail app!


### Vote of thanks
I would like to thank everyone (known and unknown) who supported me in making Japin a reality (directly or indirectly). Alert: the list may include apparently non living things!

* I am thankful to my University, my PhD guide Prof. Sanjoy Kumar Saha and my project guide Prof. Saikat Mookherjee who allowed me to invest so much time in developing this app
* I am thankful to my Lab-mates who never complained about doing my part while I was coding this app rather supported me in their own ways, grads and undergrads who work with me also had been very encouraging in this venture. 
* I am thankful to my mother. I am thankful to my would be in-laws and my fianc√©e. Sorry but I do not have the required vocabulary to express my feelings in this regard.
* I am thankful to my friends who tested this app for me.
* I am thankful to the numerous authors of Stackoverflow, to the content creators in Youtube specially the channel "Coding in Flow" and many others whose solutions, suggestions and guides made this app possible by a single developer in a months time. Thank you guys from the bottom of my heart :)
* I am thankful to my laptop, a 2011 model HP 630 notebook running Ubuntu 16.04 equipped with a 4GB DDR3 RAM and 1st gen Corei5 processor. Its Wifi is broken, the battery is almost dead, keyboard doesn't work and it needs restart every few hours (developers can imaging how it works after running Android Studio for an hour!). It stood with me like a comrade in war, struck with bullets and shrapnels yet covering me with all its might(sorry if I sound a bit too emotional but I can't help myself)! 

### Why I built Japin?
I will answer it a little later, maybe after 10K active daily users :)
