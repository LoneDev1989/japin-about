## About Japin
In the age of many social media giants, Japin is just a new kid in the block with very limited features and capabilities but having some firsts of its own. Japin is a social network with pictures in each post. People joining Japin can admire people and see their pictures in their feed or wall, rate it from 1 to 5, comment on them and share them. The new thing is the pictures stays in the network based on the number of initial audience of the post and the total stars that post gets. When the post or picture dissapears, it adds a medal to the profile depending on the stars that the post received. Japin has an in-built camera and picture editing tool which lets people play around with multiple filters on top of one another. There are many shortcomings of Japin in its present version. There is a cap on the number of admirers that one can have, sharing and searching is very primitive, there is no provision of reply comments etc. Japin is developed entirely by a single person and so its capabilities are limited to the technical and infrastructural limitations of the developer himself. But I promise to work on the problems with the best of my capabilities to make Japin more interesting and engaging. Japin uses some libraries so there are constraints from them also but with time as those constraints diminishes, Japin will mature too.

### FAQs
Below are some possible FAQs which I think, will pop up at first. list of FAQs will increase in future.


* What inspired the name "Japin" and its logo?\
The logo of Japin is inspired partially by instagram and the shield of Captain America! Thje name "Japin" is a short for Just Another Picture Network, and yes it is inspired from "Jarvis" - Just A Rather Very Intelligent System!

* What is the business model of Japin or LoneDev?\
Japin is a ad supported free Android app. Japin uses only banner ads and that too only in the activity that talks too much with the server. This is to make the app as less annoying as possible. LoneDev is an indipendent app creator with no financial backers so keeping ads is the least possible option to make Japin free of cost. It is expected that Japin will earn some more money from showing ads than it will spend in Firebase bills, that more sum is its only revenue for now!

* Who is LoneDev?\
LoneDev is an independent app creator which is the alias for Aritra Mukherjee (LoneDev sounds a lot more cool!). I am a PhD scholar at Jadavpur University, India working on a thesis on robot vision and SLAM. 


### Vote of thanks
