## About Japin
In the age of many social media giants, Japin is just a new kid in the block with very limited features and capabilities but having some firsts of its own. Japin is a social network with pictures in each post. People joining Japin can admire people and see their pictures in their feed or wall, rate it from 1 to 5, comment on them and share them. The new thing is the pictures stays in the network based on the number of initial audience of the post and the total stars that post gets. When the post or picture dissapears, it adds a medal to the profile depending on the stars that the post received. Japin has an in-built camera and picture editing tool which lets people play around with multiple filters on top of one another. There are many shortcomings of Japin in its present version. There is a cap on the number of admirers that one can have, sharing and searching is very primitive, there is no provision of reply comments etc. Japin is developed entirely by a single person and so its capabilities are limited to the technical and infrastructural limitations of the developer himself. But I promise to work on the problems with the best of my capabilities to make Japin more interesting and engaging. Japin uses some libraries so there are constraints from them also but with time as those constraints diminishes, Japin will mature too.
